#### ERC-20 Token in the DeFi world

Let's see how can we use ERC-20 Tokens in some of the most popular DeFi platforms.

Follow these steps to get some DAI tokens and use them as collateral to get some USDC tokens:

##### 1.  Get a Kovan ETH [here](https://faucet.kovan.network/)
##### 2.  Set your Metamask to the Kovan Network
##### 3.  Use Uniswap to swap part of your ETH (eg. 0.5) to some DAI tokens [here](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
